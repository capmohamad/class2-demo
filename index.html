<p> As an airline pilot, you'll fly passengers or cargo on long or short-haul flights for leisure, business or commercial purposes.

    The aircraft is typically operated by two pilots; one will be the captain who is the pilot in command, while the other will be the supporting first officer. Pilots usually take turns to fly the plane to avoid fatigue, with one operating the controls, while the other speaks to air traffic control and completes the paperwork.
    
    In some instances, such as long-haul flights, there may be three or four pilots on board so that each can take the necessary breaks from flying.
    
    The captain has overall responsibility for the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft and the safety of crew and passengers.
    
    You'll face heavy responsibility and personal commitment. You have to pass stringent training courses, followed by recurrent training every six months, in order to maintain the relevant licence required for the job.
